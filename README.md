# dude...really?
You need to be more careful.

It's not a smart idea to post your credentials on [public forums](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/issues/5304), lol. Anyone could have had access to your Mongo account, GitHub, email and more. I would really reccomend deleting your comment on that thread and changing all of your passwords.

Consider this a friendly warning that a lot worse could have happened!

Happy coding! :)
